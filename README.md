### Dynamic Experiments for Estimating Preferences (DEEP)

In trying to understand choices, people would like to know the decision maker's underlying preferences. DEEP (Toubia et al, 2013) is a novel methodology to elicit individuals' risk (DEEP Risk) or time (DEEP Time) preferences by dynamically (i.e., adaptively) optimizing the sequences of questions presented to each subject, while leveraging information about the distribution of the parameters across individuals (heterogeneity) and modeling response error explicitly.

**To launch your own DEEP survey, refer to our** [survey page](http://). When survey is completed by enough subjects, install the **DEEPEst** package and start estimation.

# DEEPEst

This R package provides functions to execute hierarchical Bayesian estimation for DEEP using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) (via the **rstan** package). These high level functions will automatically call [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) functions so that you don't need to dive into them by yourself. There are also some functions for posterior analysis on estimates of both time and risk preferences parameters.

### Installation

To install from GitHub, please first install the **rstan** package and C++ toolchain with these [instructions](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).
Then, you can install **DEEPEst** from GitHub using the **devtools** package by executing the following in R:

```r
devtools::install_github("ColumbiaCDS/DEEPEst")
```

If installation fails, please let us know by [filing an issue](https://github.com/ColumbiaCDS/DEEPEst/issues).

### Run Estimation

Download the original survey data csv file into your working directory `path`. And for illustration, let's say the working directory `path` here is "./DEEP Your_Name". 

Then, rename this original csv file to be "DEEP_{model}\_surveydata\_{project_name}.csv". Here, "{model}" should be either "Time" or "Risk" depending on your project and "{project_name}" should be a unique name indentifying this project. For example, you may name it as "DEEP_Time_surveydata_StudyNo1.csv".

Then execute the following:

```r
# For DEEP Time
library(DEEPEst)
Time_data_prepare(project_name = "StudyNo1", path = path, num_question = 12)
Stan_Time_Estimation(project_name = "StudyNo1", num_question_Est = 12, num_question = 12, type_theta = "Hier", path = path)

# For DEEP Risk
library(DEEPEst)
Risk_data_prepare(project_name = "StudyNo1", path = path, num_question = 12)
Stan_Risk_Estimation(project_name = "StudyNo1", num_question_Est = 12, num_question = 12, type_theta = "Hier", path = path)
```

```r
Stan_Time_Estimation(project_name,
	num_question_Est,
	num_question,
	type_theta,

```

#### Description

The main functions to do estimation on DEEP Time and Risk data. This function will automatically call stan models. It will return a large stanfit object called "hier_time" if `save_out=FALSE`. Otherwise, return nothing but save the stanfit object into a local RData file as this example:
<img src="images/stan_time_estimation.png" width = 500 alt="Stan Time Estimation"/>

#### Arguments

* project_name: The name of this study. 
* num_question_Est: How many questions you want to use in estimation.
* num_question: How many questions are asked for each subject.
* type_theta: Type of scaling response noise parameter used in estimation, specify either "Global", "Individual" or "Hier".
* path: Full path for working directory.
* save_out: Whether save the stanfit object as a rdata file. The default is "TRUE".
* chains: A positive integer specifying the number of Markov chains. The default is 3.
* iter: A positive integer specifying the number of iterations for each chain (including warmup). The default is 1000.
* thin: A positive integer specifying the period for saving samples. The default is 3.
* adapt_delta: A double value between 0 and 1 controlling the accept probability in sampling. The default is 0.9.
* max_treedepth: A positive integer specifying how deep in tree exploration. The default is 12.
* stepsize: A double and positive value controlling sampler's behavior. The default is 1.

<details><summary>Time_data_prepare, Risk_data_prepare</summary>

```r
Time_data_prepare(project_name,
	path, 
	num_question,
	clean_time = T, 
	clean_side = T, 
	each_seconds = 3)

Risk_data_prepare(project_name,
	path, 
	num_question,
	clean_time = T, 
	clean_side = T, 
	each_seconds = 3)
```

#### Description

Read and denoise the original suvery output data. Only complete rows would be reserved. In addition, this function automatically drops those "unengaged" responses (noisy ones with only random choices, not involving utility consideration). Three csv files will be saved under directory indicated by `path` and used in estimation functions. Examples:
<img src="images/time_data_prepare.png" width = 500 alt="Estimates CSV"/>

#### Arguments

* project_name: The name of this study. 
* path: Full path for working directory.
* num_question: How many questions are asked for each subject in this suvery.
* each_seconds: How many seconds spent on each question on average so that the observation would be considered as a reasonable response.
* clean_time: Logical value. Default is `TRUE` means you want to denoise the original data by dropping all responses which are completed within `num_question` times `each_seconds` seconds.
* clean_side: Logical value. Default is `TRUE` means you want to denoise the original data by dropping all responses which only contain one-side options, namely, only left or right options chosen.
